# PomodoroPrototype
This is an Prototype, meant to be used as a co-working Stream Timer, with an Greenscreeen Mode build in.
Currently this Protoype is able to	
	- play music that is located in the playlist folder the program would create and it currently only supports .wav files
	- keep track about the to dos with an Tasklist and its .txt file, the structure is explained in the template the program would create at first start.
	- Set times with preset Menu or by adding hour/minute with the Arrows.

Unlike the Tasklist, the music Player could not be reloaded on runtime yet.
The Code looks a bit messy because it was a side Project in exam-phase while taking breaks of studying

Currently I dont know how far I would improve this Protoype, my Goal is to Re-Write it in Bevy(Rust) as a small project to learn Bevy.

It currently could happen that the first track of the playlist is starting twice, or with the second one, until now I couldnt figure out what causes this, it doesent occur every time.
